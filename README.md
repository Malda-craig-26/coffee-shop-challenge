# â˜• Coffee Shop Challenge

This project models a simple coffee shop system using Python OOP principles. It includes three main classes â€” `Customer`, `Coffee`, and `Order` â€” with their associated behaviors and relationships.

## ðŸ“š Features

- Create and manage **customers** with name validation.
- Create **coffee** types with immutable names.
- Track **orders** that associate customers and coffee types at a specific price.
- Prevent invalid data through type checking and value constraints.
- Query relationships:
  - Orders per customer or coffee
  - Unique coffees a customer has tried
  - Unique customers who have tried a coffee
  - Number and average price of orders for a coffee
